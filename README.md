# Update_MyFirstWeb
# Since this is one of my first projects in the journey to becoming a programmer, there are still many areas for improvement, and the application is not yet fully complete. I welcome feedback and will continue refining it as I develop my skills.

🔁 Project: Update_MyFirstWeb – Full Stack Blog Web App (KIT202 Assignment 2)
This project is an updated and extended version of my original MyFirstWeb frontend blog application, developed for Assignment 2 of the KIT202 Web Programming Fundamentals unit at the University of Tasmania.

The aim of this version was to transform the static frontend into a dynamic, database-driven blog using:

🧱 PHP for server-side scripting

🗃️ MariaDB for database management

🖼️ HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for the frontend interface

🔧 Key Functionalities Implemented
User Authentication System: Users can register, log in, and log out

User Roles:

Visitor: View public pages (home, about, login, register)

Member: Access archive and view full blog content

Author: Can create new posts

Secure Form Handling: All user inputs are validated on both frontend and backend

Dynamic Content: Blog posts are loaded from the database, with real-time creation and archive filtering

Role-based Navigation: The menu and accessible pages change depending on user roles and login status

Password Security: User passwords are stored using secure hashing techniques

Admin/Member Demo Accounts for testing login functionality

🗂 Pages & Features
index.php – Homepage displaying the 4 latest posts

archive.php – Archive of older blog entries with toggleable full content

login.php / register.php – User authentication and registration with backend validation

create.php – Post creation form (authors only)

about.php – Group details, admin/member test account credentials, and references

✨ HD Extensions
Dynamic session-based navigation

Role-based content restriction

Form data sanitisation and error handling

Use of modular components to reduce code duplication

Optional: post search, comment system, or rating system (if implemented)

This updated version demonstrates full-stack web development, combining a user-friendly frontend with secure and functional backend architecture.
